    "# Introduction\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the top 40 quarterbacks in the NFL based on four key metrics: Expected Points Added Per Play, Completion Percentage Over Expectation, Yards Per Play, and Touchdowns Per Play / Turnovers Per Play. Traditional stats such as passing touchdowns, total yards, and completion percentage can be misleading as they are very dependent on the situation, so these stats will hopefully provide a better analysis. It is a tight MVP race this year with Aaron Rodgers and Pat Mahomes the favorites and Josh Allen surging. Let's see who the stats favor."

    "Have a season, Aaron Rodgers! A hallmark of Rodgers' career has been producing touchdowns while avoiding turnovers, but it's striking to see him so much better than the next best QB in this statistic, Tua Tagovailoa (how about that for a surprise!). He takes care of the ball so well while also being among the leaders in YPP. Dak Prescott leads that category, but hasn't played a game since October due to injury. Of note: Tagovailoa has done a great job protecting the ball and producing touchdowns in his young career, but has been pulled from games due to his inability to generate yardage, where he is among the league's worst. Interestingly, his QB counterpart in Miami, Ryan Fitzpatrick, is the exact opposite, as he is nearly top-five in YPP but below average in taking care of the football."

Tom Brady and Ryan Fitzpatrick are having career resurgences, while Cam Newton looks like he may have exited his prime for good.
