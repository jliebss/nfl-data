This project aims to analyze the top 40 quarterbacks in the NFL based on four key metrics: Expected Points Added Per Play, Completion Percentage Over Expectation, Yards Per Play, and Touchdowns Per Play / Turnovers Per Play. Traditional stats such as passing touchdowns, total yards, and completion percentage can be misleading as they are very dependent on the situation, so these stats will hopefully provide a better analysis. It is a tight MVP race this year with Aaron Rodgers and Pat Mahomes the favorites and Josh Allen surging. Let's see who the stats favor.

EPA - Expected Points Added: the average Expected Points Added per play in which an offensive player is directly involved. EPA/P is a measure of an individual playerâ€™s impact on the scores of his games, on a per play basis.

CPOE - Completion Percentage Over Expectation: the quarterback's actual completion percentage minus the expected completion percentage.

YPP - Yards Per Play: the average pass or rush yards gained each play by the quarterback.

TD/Turnover Ratio: the average touchdowns scored each play divided by the average fumbles or interceptions each play. (Note: I include all fumbles, not just fumbles lost, because once fumbled it is primarily based on luch which team recovers.)
